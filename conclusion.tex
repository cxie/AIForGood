\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report, we have endeavored to comprehensively discuss many of most critical aspects of foundation models, ranging from their technical foundations to their societal consequences.
In this way, we acknowledge the unusual approach taken: we have attempted to clarify the nature of a paradigm that may only have just begun, rather than waiting for more to unfold or the dust to settle.
Therefore, much still remains unclear in spite of our efforts and we reiterate that this is just the beginning of a paradigm shift: foundation models have only just begun to transform the way AI systems are built and deployed in the world.
Moving forward, we view this document as serving an important role in orienting and framing dialogue on these models and this new paradigm in AI. 
That said, to ensure the responsible development and deployment of these models on durable foundations, we envision collaboration between different sectors, institutions, and disciplines from the onset to be especially critical. 
% The immense capability surface of these models is a double-edged sword: these capabilities afford new opportunities to build improved AI applications but pose new risks to support malicious misuse.
% Further, this paradigm introduces new challenges: h


% This indicates that there are both opportunities in store that, to be reaped, which will require building foundation models on steadier foundations, and risks in store that, to be addressed, will require  

% Rishi: Everything above is me seeing what Percy was writing and piecing some of it together, while also being somewhat brief. Instead of recapitulating some of the key ideas, I mostly took the approach of trying to clarify a) there is still a lot to be understood (also will speak to humility, which is good), b) what comes next, and c) in particular, that we really need to embrace community to make progress. That said, in c) I don't as strongly emphasize the points on open science, transparency, reproducibility, or so on, but it might be better to articulate those more forcefully/the last sentence maybe is a little bit weird as an ending (though it is hortative and community-minded, which seems good).  

% Emergence means that these behaviors are more discovered than constructed;
% therefore, it is likely that we have only scratched the surface.

% Foundation models are already transforming the way AI systems are built and
% deployed to the world.
% And while there are many new opportunities, but we are building on shaky
% foundation, and there is still so much to be understood.

% With so much still unknown about the capability surface, there is justifiable
% concern about adversarial or malicious deployment cases. And just as is true
% about earlier AI paradigms, there are widespread concerns about fairness and
% bias in foundation models, whether they are explainable or auditable, and what
% the broader social consequences of widespread adoption might be, such as job
% displacement. Consequently, responsible development of these powerful models
% must incorporate serious attention to these concerns from the outset.

%Second, we need to keep an open ecosystem where innovation can happen
%transparently.  We need things to be reproducible and accessible to all the
%stakeholders, and allow the technology to develop in a transparent way.  At the
%time, given the potential of this technology, we need to ensure that safeguards
%are put in place to prevent misuse (either through technological or policy
%solutions).

%Finally, the amount of progress that has been made in the last three years have
%been astounding.
