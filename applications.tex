\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

The capabilities (\refsec{capabilities}) of foundation models indicate that they have the potential to transform various sectors and industries, extending the role AI plays in society (\refsec{society}). 
Among the myriad applications where foundation models may be applied, we will focus on three disciplines\dash{}healthcare (\refsec{healthcare}), law (\refsec{law}), and education (\refsec{law})\dash{}that are all foundational to societal function. Within each, we discuss the opportunities that foundation models pose for this domain alongside challenges (\eg~interpretability; \refsec{interpretability}) and concerns (\eg~privacy; \refsec{security}).

\pl{talk more about these serious applications, where data scarcity is a thing and expert annotation is cheap (can't just crowdsource); and sometimes can't just go and scrape data directly (although might expect transfer to still be useful}

% Foundation models have the potential to transform and extend the reach of AI across many sectors and impact people's lives.  While there are a myriad of applications, we have chosen three applications\dash{}healthcare, law, and education---because they represent foundational pillars of our society.  These applications leverage the capabilities discussed in \refsec{capabilities} and also raise technical and societal challenges such as privacy and interpretability.
