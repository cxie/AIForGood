The societal impact of foundation models, referring both to the construction of the models themselves and their role in developing applications, requires careful examination.
Specifically, we anticipate that foundation models will have wide-ranging societal consequences that are challenging to understand: foundation models are intermediary assets that are not directly deployed, but rather serve as a foundation that is further adapted.
As a result, traditional approaches to reasoning about the societal impact of technology are likely complicated; societal impact is easier (but still difficult) to grasp for systems with well-specified purposes.
In this chapter, we discuss how we may grapple with and beginning to understand the complexity of the societal impact of models foundation models.
Specifically, we discuss (i) the harms with respect to inequity (\refsec{fairness}) and misuse (\refsec{misuse}), (ii) the impact with respect to the economy (\refsec{economics}) and environment (\refsec{environment}), and (iii) the broader considerations with respect to the law (\refsec{legality}) and ethics (\refsec{ethics}). 

\pl{Flesh this out more to talk about:
(i) overall idea of social benefit, as distinct from corporate economic benefit;
(ii) inequality as being a recurring theme;
and anything else that's recurring
